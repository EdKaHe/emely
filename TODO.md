# TODO

## Features

- [ ] **Add further noise models**: E.g. Rice or Rayleigh distribution.

- [ ] **Write tests for absolute sigma_y estimates**: Add a new test to validate the estimated absolute sigma_y

- [ ] **Support for x-axis uncertainties (σₓ)**: Extend the MLE framework to account for measurement errors in the independent variable (x-axis), not just the dependent variable (y-axis).

- [ ] **Likelihood profiling for confidence intervals**: Implement confidence interval estimation using the likelihood profiling method as an complement to the current Fisher information matrix approach.
